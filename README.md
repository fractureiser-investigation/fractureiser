# Modded Minecraft Malware "fractureiser"

## What?
`fractureiser` is a [worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm) virus and info stealer found in several Minecraft projects uploaded to CurseForge and CraftBukkit's dev website. The malware is embedded in multiple mods, some of which were added to highly popular modpacks.

If left unchecked, fractureiser can be **INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS** to your machine. Please read through this document for the info you need to keep yourself safe.

We've dubbed this malware `fractureiser` because that's the name of the CurseForge account that uploaded the most notable malicious files.  

*Pardon our dust*, this is a living document being edited by multiple people about a developing situation. Some sections may be messy.

## Current Investigation Status
We have a good idea how fractureiser works, from stages 0 to 3. There are certain
unknowns, but stage 0 bootstrapping was quickly nipped and tomorrow we'll be moving our
focus to mitigation.

Work has begun on a detector for infected stage 0 mods:
https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector and arranging for this detector to be run on
Modrinth.

The threat actors attempted to bring up a new server IP. In the process, they accidentally
uploaded an unobfuscated version of Stage 3. This allowed us to further understand the
malware and what it does.

As of the time of writing this new control IP has been taking offline by its hosting provider.
