## What?
`fractureiser` is a [Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus) found in several Minecraft projects uploaded to CurseForge and CraftBukkit's dev website. The malware is embedded in multiple mods, some of which were added to highly popular modpacks. The Malware is only known to target Windows and Linux Systems.

If left unchecked, fractureiser can be **INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS** to your machine. Please read through this document for the info you need to keep yourself safe.

We've dubbed this malware `fractureiser` because that's the name of the CurseForge account that uploaded the most notable malicious files.  

## What YOU need to know

### I have never used any minecraft mods

You are not infected.

## Current Investigation Status
We have a good idea how fractureiser works, from Stages 0 to 3. There are certain
unknowns, but the attack servers are offline and to our knowledge, *new* infections are
not possible. Old infections may still be active.

We are currently working on refining user-facing documentation, please check there for
resources.

## Follow up Meeting
On 2023-06-08 the fractureiser Mitigation Team held a meeting with notable members of the community to discuss preventive measures and solutions for future problems of this scale.
See [this page](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser/blob/main/docs/2023-06-08-meeting.md) for the agenda and minutes of the event.
