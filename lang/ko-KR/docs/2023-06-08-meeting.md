## 사건과 대응 요약

(이것은 참석자들이 빠르게 정보를 파악할 수 있도록 하는 목적으로 주로 제공되며, 소리내어 읽을 필요는 없습니다.)

`fractureiser`는 Bukkit 플러그인, Forge 모드, Fabric 모드 및 기본 Minecraft JAR 파일을 감염시키는 혁신적인 자체 복제 바이러스입니다. 감염된 JAR 파일은 로드될 때 정상적으로 실행되지만, 로그인 토큰, 저장된 브라우저 비밀번호/결제 정보 및 암호화폐를 도용하는 일련의 페이로드를 조용히 다운로드합니다. 컴퓨터가 감염된 후, 감염 가능한 시스템의 모든 JAR 파일이 감염됩니다. 따라서 이러한 파일이 다른 컴퓨터에서 공유되고 실행되면 감염이 전파됩니다. 감염된 Curseforge 로그인 토큰은 대규모 모드 프로젝트에 액세스하고 감염된 JAR 파일을 사용자에게 배포하는 데 사용되었습니다.

이 문제에 대한 토론과 대응은 6월 6일부터 본격적으로 시작되었습니다. 샘플은 점차적으로 발견, 식별 및 디컴파일되었습니다. 악성 코드를 전파하고 비밀번호/토큰을 도용하는 페이로드의 소스가 식별되었으며, 빠르게 호스트인 Serverion에 의해 차단되었습니다. 감염된 JAR 파일은 더 이상 진행되거나 악성 코드를 전파할 수 없지만, 노드가 종료되기 전에 감염된 경우 여전히 활성화될 수 있습니다.

현재로서는 공격자가 새로운 악성 코드 반복을 시도할 경우 그 명령 및 제어 노드를 가능한 한 빨리 차단할 수 있도록 악성 코드를 역공학하는 샘플이 계속 발견되고 있습니다. 6월 7일에 공격자가 새로운 노드를 만들려고 시도한 것이 다시 호스트에 의해 빠르게 차단되었습니다. 이제는 사용되지 않는 이 노드를 가리키는 웹 URL이 발견되었으며, 현재 주시하고 있습니다.

## 안건

우리에게는 약 1시간 정도의 시간이 있으므로 각 주제당 최대 15분을 할애해 보겠습니다. 주제는 행동 가능성이 높은 순으로 구성되어 있습니다. 현실적으로 어떤 것이 그다지 가능성이 없다면 순위가 낮습니다. 시간이 부족하면 해당 주제를 건너뛸 수 있습니다.

### Opaque Review Processes/Security by Obscurity

#### Discussion and Action Items

- What does CurseForge/Modrinth *do* when reviewing a mod?
  - Insert  "what do you do here" meme :)
- What automated checks *are* being run?
  - ?
- What automated checks *should* be put in place?
  - Static analysis?
  - Can we get mod repos to commit to these action plans?
- Semi-OT: Can we get a checksum algorithm that is not MD5 on CF please? MD5 has been
  known broken for years and this made us wary of attempted editing/collision attacks for
  longer than necessary
  - What does Modrinth use?

Minutes:

Fury: CEO of overwolf. Eng is working on mitigations, so I'm here  
	Re: checks. From a high-level perspective. Don't want to be too open about the checks  
	because people can find ways to bypass. Understand that the ambiguity is a concern,  
	will share as much as I can.  
	All mods have auto checks. Manual checks for some.  
	Technically, start by running antivirus/antimalware scans. Check file type/adherence to file structure.  
	API actually supports SHA-1.  
	More clientside improvements to enforce this in a good way.  
	Manual checks when an auto check flags it, human reviews the mod. Changing text/images also involves manual review.  
	Continuously evolving process, have updated automated tests to look for this vuln.  
	
Emi: Moving to modrinth to keep things quick

Geo/Jay: Founder of Modrinth. Our moderation is pretty robust.
	New project: manual review. Check description, images. Also check the source code, esp. for new/unknown authors.
	Closed source, will occasionally decompile mods, but not often.
	Checks on backend for file structure.
	Malware in modded mc is generally never detected by antivirus.
	Have rejected mods in the past for suspicious code.
	Understand this process is flawed. After initial review, we rely on reports afterwards.
	Our code is open source, we want a transparent tool the community can use.
	Relies on community trust (known author), but this is also flawed.
	
Emi: When you check open source mods, do you verify the source corresponds to the jar?

Geo: No, but we could do something where users can upload the source for a verified badge,
like what npm has recently does. Might not be most ideal.

Emi: Which hash is used by Modrinth

Geo: We use SHA-1/SHA-512. Avaiable in API. Launcher we're building validates
them. Rehashed all files in SHA-512 a year ago.



### Reproducible Builds

One thing that would have helped in the "scanning for tampered mods" part of the response,
was if we knew a specific mod version only had one possible binary output. That is,
reproducible builds given a source checkout. We could have simply rebuilt the mod in
question from source, taken its hash, and compared it to the file under scrutiny to detect
stage 0 infection, rather than going through the complicated exercise of trying to scan
for signatures in the code.

How many of our mods have build scripts plugins or deps with unpinned floating
`-SNAPSHOT` version specifiers in them?

I'm willing to bet all of them, because both
[Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod/blob/1.20/build.gradle#L2) and
[Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.19.x/mdk/build.gradle#L4)
have example mods that do just that.

Gradle plugins like Loom and FG traditionally did this so that they could push fixes and
iterate quickly without user action, but it's important now to have auditability.

Supply chain attacks from random modding Mavens being hacked is a very real threat.

#### Discussion and Action Items

- Stop promoting usage of `-SNAPSHOT` in example templates and documentation in favor of
  fixed version numbers
- Update fabric-example-mod and forge MDK example to use Gradle checksum verification and/or locking?
  - https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html
    - This is the traditional "write hashes into a file and check them" lockfile approach
  - https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html
    - This is "lock any ranged dependency declarations like `[1, 2)` to one specific
      version until told to update"
- Stand up a working group in Loom/FG to investigate reproducible builds when the gradle
  [flag](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:reproducible_archives)
  is set. There may be nondeterminism introduced by parts of the modding toolchain such as
  jar remappers. Each instance needs to be rooted out such that a mod builds reproducibly
  out of the box.
- Crazy idea: F-Droid style, submit source and it gets built by the mod repo?
  - Expensive capacity wise, unlikely to happen.

Starchild: For Quilt, one issue here is signing. We can't reproduce a signature.

willie: But if the signature is distributed separately, should be fine?

Geo: We can never be 100% secure. We can spend a lot of time reviewing every file.  One
important thing is accessibility. Many people don't know how Gradle works/what
reproducible builds are. Template mods exist, but even code signing is hard for mobile devs.
We get thousands of submissions a day.

Fury: One thing we suggest, for authors that opt to go through extra verification have a
tag on their mod for gamers to see to increase trust.

### Mods Downloading External Files

Mods that download external files which contain executable code are vulnerable to a supply chain attack.

Some existing examples of mods that do this are:
- [Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential)
  - Automatic updater downloads any updates without prompting user. If the Essential
    update servers are compromised, the malicious code will be downloaded upon launching
    minecraft.
- Mods depending on [owolib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib), such as [gadget](https://modrinth.com/mod/gadget)
  - Will prompt the user to download owo-lib, which will download the jar from
    modrinth. If a malicious jar is added to modrinth with the correct version, it can
    perform a supply chain attack.

Should one of the more popular mods, such as Essential, be compromised, it would allow malware to quickly propagate to millions of users.

#### Discussion and Action Items

- Should mods uploaded to platforms (Modrinth, CurseForge, etc.) be permitted to download
  files containing executable code from external sources?
  - I think no, but how would we enforce this? Start the game with the mod and check it
    doesn't download anything new into the mods folder?

Fury: Manually review when we see this pattern happen

willie: But you can push malicious code later

Fury: look at the author's reputation and other attributes of safety.

Starchild: Not too down to ban downloading everything from the internet. See some
legitimate usecases. We can mark the mod on the platform as downloading external code.
Can have policies like must do over https, etc. We can draft it in the community.

willie: Clarification: I mean talking about downloading code, not data

Lambda: TODO(willie i missed first half) Quilt had a proposal to do dependency
downloading.  More generally, only allow downloading of things that were predeclared
(e.g. with a hash). Even if we allow mods that do this, I will still stay suspicious.

### Code Signing

Binary artifacts released to mod repos should be signed by their author.

Templates and help docs for e.g. Fabric Loom and ForgeGradle should make the UX as easy as
possible to:

- Build releases in CI
- Sign jars in CI at build time
- Upload the signed jars to mod repos in CI

Moving release creation to CI is already more than what many modders do (most people don't
even tag their releases). Keep in mind many modders are amateur programmers that have not
worked in industry and don't know what any of this is.

I can't stress how important it is for this to be as well documented, easy, and
ready-to-use as possible this is, or else no one will use it.

Eventually, mod repos should require signatures for every single upload and reject any
unsigned artifact outright. This will need a rollout period, and still require good
education materials.

#### Discussion and Action Items

- Where should public keys be held and associated with their authors? In other words, what
  prevents a hacker from replacing a public key as well as the signed binary at the same
  time?
  - In the modrinth user account (behind 2fa)?
    - Without organization accounts this can be annoying for mods that can be uploaded by
      multiple people?
    - If Modrinth is compromised a hacker can replace the pubkey and uploade a new signed
      binary at the same time
- PGP signing or java jarsigner stuff?
  - PGP is the standard and used for Maven Central. My impression is no one uses the java
    specific stuff. OpenSSH signing is also an option but is much newer and has no
    established ecosystem. PGP is probably the best choice, unfortunately. We can automate
    away all the crappy parts of it with helpers in Gradle plugins.
- Prior art
  - Forge has had support for signature stuff for years and it's gone unused. What can we
    learn from it?
- Launchers should likely include UI elements to indicate mod signature verification status.
- Immediate followups
  - Modrinth and CurseForge design how public key association/storage will work
  - Mod loaders write extensive documentation about how to:
    1. Create releases in CI using git tags
    2. Automatically sign and upload artifacts from CI

Emi: this doesn't necessitate a required process

Starchild: What do we want to prevent here and where? Mod repo can just associate a key
with the user and require it in upload, but enforcement/verification can also happen in
the loader.

Jasmine: I recently uploaded to Maven Central which enforces code signing. Process was
mostly painless via buildscripts, hardest part was finding the docs.

Emi: Relaying from text chat, what is the point of signing? The main reason is for
identifying actors.

cpw: Wrote codesigning for Forge, been there around 10y. It might have detected stage0 and
probably stage3 if the signature wasn't stripped. We've wanted people to do it. Most
people in Forge use it these days. Fingerprints for signatures show up in debug logs,
etc. That's the primary purpose. IMO needs to be pushed a layer up. There is no mechanism
to distribute trust. A modder can tell their *own* jar is good, but the user doesn't. That
requires a trust authority in the mc ecosystem. Setting one is a complex endeavour. Only
viable actor is CF and Modrinth, since they already track the stuff you need to track. +1
on badging on the mod repos. Doing it on the clientside? We're far too late for that at
the moment. If the entire ecosystem was signed, we could revisit.

Emi: Is it possible to have a collaboratively controlled third party CA? Adding two steps
is a bit much.

cpw: You can sign with multiple CA's at once, so that isn't necessary

Fury: We can look into it.

cpw: If you're committing to it, that's awesome :)

Geo: IMO would be best if a trusted third party does it. Diff platforms have diff
policies. Modrinth interested in this as well, but we have to move carefully. 

Emi: Are you willing to work with CurseForge for a third party CA?

Geo: Yeah. Everyone should put their differences aside for security, even though Modrinth
wasn't affected it still was indirectly since "

cpw: Would be nice to see movement after 10y

### Sandboxing

Sandboxing the Minecraft process is another defense strategy that can be used to limit the
blast radius of attacks coming from malicious mod code.

In general, it's a hard problem.

Minecraft should only need access to:

- The internet, to authenticate, log into servers, etc.
- Filesystem access to the `.minecraft` instance folder and its recursive descendants

The main thing of interest to lock down here is filesystem access.

On Windows, there does not seem to be any simple to deploy sandboxing system (besides
"play bedrock"). The closest is Chromium's
[model](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md)
which would require significant invasive changes to the game.

On macOS, we *could* use Apple's built in sandboxing system known as ["Seatbelt"](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox/osx-sandboxing-design/). It is already enforced in apple's app store, but not external apps like Minecraft. However it is still not possible to use it to restrict network access to certain sites.
Below is a image which shows its file permission config which we can use to restrict its access. This could prove to be good enough for what is needed to limit malware and attacks from the code.
![image](media/sandboxfile.png)


On Linux, we have a couple options. First is SELinux/AppArmor. These frameworks are
infamous for being insanely hard to configure and as a result have not been widely
deployed. However, the policies we seek are quite simple, so it's possible this could be
an avenue.

In OpenBSD parlance, all we want to do is [`unveil(2)`](https://man.openbsd.org/unveil) to
all paths in the instance root, but unfortunately this interface isn't available in Linux.

Second, is using a system such as Flatpak.


timoreo: Executing untrusted code is always unsafe, regardless of what sandboxing you
have. Sandboxing is always your last resort. We have a flatpak of Prism which is sandboxed
and restricts a lot of access. Prevented this specific attack. Can be difficult, e.g. you
might think you can restrict mic, but what if a mod adding voice chat wants it? Needs to
be restricted but allow freedom for modders. Linux has a lot of techniques, can restrict
pretty much everything.

ZekeZ: Main issue is Windows and macOS, especially Windows.

Emi: Concern for several mods. Locking down fs access can be problematic for mods that
want global instance-independent configs

ZekeZ: What was the problem with EMI?

Emi: There is a user-facing option to store stuff in ~/.minecraft instead of the instance
local one

timoreo: You can case-by-case allow files. Anyways, what about network?

Recap

kennytv: Hi from Paper. Some overlap with modding, and have our own plugin repo. Would be
interested in one maintainable scanner for identifying current malware. There is a bunch
right now. On signing, Sponge also had that for a while. They basically gave on it,
because people didn't know how to use it. Very hard to get novices to understand it.

Lambda: Would like to see mod hosting to add more 2FA. Or even only allowing API/CI to
upload. That can be a bit annoying but can avoid token stealing resulting in bad
uploads. Currently don't know if Modrinth has 2fa. CurseForge has it but only for
payouts. Want to see this expanded.

Geo: Were working on 2fa before this started. Will also allow scoped tokens (e.g. unsigned
builds only from this token, signed builds only from this token) 2fa has a flaw which is
your session token is still vulnerable to compromise. LTT YouTube was compromised by
this. Planning on launching new auth stuff in a couple of weeks.

Emi: To point out, LPS authors did have 2fa.

willie: Reiterating the point about building, signing, releasing **in CI**

Geo: one thing platforms to do is a general checklist when they're first uploading a
project. On Modrinth we have a guide for literally everything. When we added descriptions
and icons to the new upload checklist, rates of doing so jumped up.

Emi: Recently implemented CI publishing. Just copied another Github workflow file. This
isn't maintainable.

Lambda: CI is not a thing a first time modder will do. There's a learning curve to
modding: experimentation, then publishing, then fix stuff after you get popular. It's very
daunting for a beginner due to lack of documentation *for modding workflows*. CI not
really in the example mod templates.

Jared: Host the BlameJared maven with lots of projects. Encourage people to use CI as much
as possible. Default MDK just publishes artifact, not even source. Need more examples and
guides to set up jenkins, etc.

willie: GH Actions is probably easier for beginners than Jenkins no?

Jared: Not familiar with GH does it now. All files on my maven are built locally, not sure
how remote publishing would work.

Emi: For a lot of mods, Maven is not strictly necessary. Can use CurseMaven/Modrinth's
maven. Useful for mods that don't intentionally expose themselves as API's.

willie: +1 that Maven's are second order, most mods are leaf content mods that don't need
Maven publishing.

Jared: CurseMaven is not a long term option. No one noticed, but CurseGradle has been
taken off Github. Its source is gone. Nobody has noticed or spoken up about it.

willie: overall action item recap

Fury: Thanks everyone. Overwolf has grown over the years. Some folks reached out and
provided valuable information. If you have further information, feel free to contact us it
would help a lot.
